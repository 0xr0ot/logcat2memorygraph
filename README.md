logcat2memorygraph
==================

a python script to generate a memory/time graph from Android logcat output, as seen in my DroidCon presentation.


There is also an old GC loging parsing script avialble from:
https://android.googlesource.com/platform/dalvik/+/gingerbread/tools/gclog.py

It is helpfull for Gingerbread and earlier versions of Android.
